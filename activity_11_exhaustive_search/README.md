# Instructions  

Draw the “search tree” for all of the possible solutions of the problem “search for all of the combinations of the letters a, b, and c with a size 3”. Draw two search trees, one using a **queue** and another one using a **stack**.  Write a sequential number next to a letter every time you push it to the queue/stack, respectively.  Write a check mark next to a letter every time you pop it from the queue/stack, respectively.  Remember that the letters get reversed when they are pushed onto the stack. At the end, describe how different the two implementations are and which one do you think is preferable?  When you are done, finish the implementation of the **exhaustive search** program.
